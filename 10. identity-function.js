// Filtering:
// When using the filter method on arrays, the identity function can be used to filter out falsy values
const identity = x => x
const arr = [0, 1, false, 2, '', 3]
const truthyArr = arr.filter(identity)
console.log(truthyArr) // [1, 2, 3]

// Middleware:
// In frameworks like Express.js, middleware functions process requests and responses.
// An identity middleware might be used as a no-op (no operation) placeholder or for debugging.
const identityMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request received at:', new Date())
    next()
}


// Testing and Mocking:
// When writing unit tests, the identity function can be used as a mock function
// to ensure that data is passed through a system unchanged.
const mockFunction = identity
const result = functionUnderTest(mockFunction)
expect(result).toBe(expectedData)



// trackByIdentity
